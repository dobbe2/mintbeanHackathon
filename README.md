# mintbeanHackathon

Here is the instructions for the Hackathon this game is being made for. I will be focusing on the front-end build.

Instructions
May the odds be in your favour. Build me a card game.
Playing cards are at least ten centuries old. There are many decks, many games for each deck, and many variants of each game, and all that complexity makes the world of playing cards a fascinating subject of conversation, study, and of course, play.

Today, your challenge is to build ONE of the below:

Frontend (easy): Build a single-player in-browser card game.

Backend (easy): Build an API that lets authenticated players play a card game over HTTP.

Fullstack (hard): Combine the above and build a multiplayer in-browser card game.

You can build any game you'd like. Whether it's poker, blackjack, or just high-card wins, as long as it sticks to the following requirements:
Your game must be played with cards from the standard 52-card deck.
Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, getting rid of all your cards.
Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, scoring the lowest number of points.
Accidental duplications of a card will be considered a bug, for which you will lose points. (See the scoring rubric for more details on how bugs affect your score)
No collectible card games or non-standard decks allowed (so for example, no Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic the Gathering, or Pokemon. And no Tarot cards either.)
For backend applications
There is no need to build a UI.
Your API must support sign up and sign in. Auth0 is fine.
There must be some meaningful reason for the backend to exist. For example, tracking the player's own scores or points (easy), or having a leaderboard (medium), or having multiplayer (hard).
You must provide clear documentation and examples for your API.
For full-stack applications
All of the requirements for Frontend and Backend applications apply.
Update, July 28, 2021
After receiving tons of feedback, we've simplified the challenge. We felt it was unfairly hard for junior developers, especially given the 1 week deadline.

We have removed the requirement for any AI or computer player
We have removed the requirement for any multiplayer
We have removed the requirement for the rules to be at least as complex as War.
We hope this makes the experience way more fun, and gives you the opportunity to put your best foot forward.

Best of luck!
